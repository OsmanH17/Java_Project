This is a Java project that makes use of the libraries to simulate a shopping app. The code uses proper class divisions, principles of OOP, and up to date programing techniques.
The program opens a very simple user interface, but very friendly. There is an initial list of items in the store storage, which the user can select from and add to their cart. 
From the cart they are able to remove or confrim sale. Once the sale is complete the app displays the company's total revenue and other neccessary information.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of OOP principles, making friendly UIs, and good coding practices.
